    "<span style=\"color:red\">General note: when referring to code in a markdown cell, it's typically easier to read and understand if the font for code is different than the rest of the text. That is why we use the \\`\\` around code. I think this is more effective than bolding (although you can do both): ex. `data_frame.sort_values()` is more easily understood as code than **data_frame.sort_values()**. This way, you can also reserve using bold to emphasize not code but **key words** that you want students to notice. Make this change if you acn, across this notebook and also the lab notebook.</span>"

    "  - Pretend you are drawing a card from the deck of cards. You draw the first card. If you were to draw without replacement, then you would have 51 cards to draw from for the next turn. However, if you draw with replacement, you draw from the 52 cards, meaning that you can draw the same card that you drew the first time again.\n",
    "- Draw as many values as the original sample contained \n",
    "  - For every resample, you will draw as many cards as the first sample (in this case 100).\n",
