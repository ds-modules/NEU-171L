    "Jupyter is an interactive, web-based python interface. Jupyter is a great tool for data-science, since you can iteratively develop your project and debug your code without having to continually reload data into memory. To run each cell of the jupyter notebook, use  𝚌𝚝𝚛𝚕+𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚎𝚛 . In addition to jupyter, three python packages are used in this notebook: numpy (to perform computations + sampling), matplotlib (to plot the data, pandas (data format and statistic methods), and scipy (statistics toolbox).\n",

    "In statistics when you perform muiltiple statisitcal tests looking for a positive result it is important to correct for multiple comparisons. The intuition behind this issue is that as you perform more and more tests the chances increase that a false positive result will occur just by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "To adjust for the mulitple comparisons we will use the Bonferroni correction method. Bonferroni correction can be used when several statistical tests are being performed simultaneously (while a given alpha (e.g. 0.05) value may be appropriate for each individual comparison, it is not for the set of all comparisons). The way this correction work is the alpha value needs to be lowered to account for the number of comparisons being performed by dividing the original alpha value (typically 0.05) by the number of test being performed.  By lowering the alpha value less signficant results are found thus avoiding a higher rate of  false positives. \n",
