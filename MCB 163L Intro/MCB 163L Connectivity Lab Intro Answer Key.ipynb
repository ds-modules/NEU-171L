However, if you draw with replacement, you draw from the 52 cards, meaning that you can draw the same card that you drew the first time again.\n",

This means that math_mean does not come from the same sample distribution as that of Fall 2018 Math 110 and `math_mean` was too large to reflect chance variation alone. We, however do not accept the `alternative hypothesis` because it could be true, but we can never totally be sure. We can just show that the `null hypothesis` is highly improvable given our data, which is why we reject it. "
