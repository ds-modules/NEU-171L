    "The **Allen Brain Institute for Brain Science** is a non-profit research institute that uses big science to understand how the brain works. One fo the projects we will be looking into is how to map gene expression and connectivity in different areas of the mouse brain. The amount of data they collect is vast – they have collected the expression patterns of over 20,000 (of about 25,000 total) genes in the mouse brain. All the data is publicly available, allowing neuroscientists to explore the comprehensive data sets, which one individual lab could never generate on their own.\n",

You will be analyzing the anatomy and neural connectivity map of the **Papez Circuit** through the limbic system in mouse brains.\n",

    "The **Papez circuit** (also known as the medial limbic circuit) is a pathway through the limbic system originally described by James Papez in 1937. He believed that this circuit was the basis of emotions, but we know now that it is actually more involved in memory formation. Damage to different components of the circuit, like the hippocampus, mammillary bodies, and fornix, can result in amnesia. Since the initial description of the circuit, we have discovered many more inputs and outputs to these structures, but the Papez circuit still serves as a good review of major limbic system pathways. We will look for this circuit using the mouse brain connectivity atlas.\n",
