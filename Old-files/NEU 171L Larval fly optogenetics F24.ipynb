    "Use this almost blank Jupyter notebook to analyze your data for the larval behaviors. You should do a Mann-Whitney U test for your behavior data for the OK6-Gal4 and ppk-Gal4 crosses. Refer to the Jupyter notebook from the adult fly lab to see how to enter your data and analyze it. We encourage you to try to make bar graphs as well, but you can use Excel for the graphs if you prefer. Remember that you can always add in extra code cells if you want to do more things than what this notebook outlines.\n",
